              <li>I love learning new things, especially in software and <span className={styles.highlight}>web development.</span></li>
              <li>I am a <span className={styles.highlight}>professional software developer for more than 10 years,</span> currently employed in a web agency as technical lead.</li>
              <li>I work on Java web backends since 2014, but my interest has recently turned to <span className={styles.highlight}>full stack development</span> with all its glory and challenges.</li>
